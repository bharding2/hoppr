#### The name of our project is Hoppr.
* Hoppr was an idea that was proposed by our group leader,  Ben Harding.
* Hoppr was made for brewers as a resource to aid in the process of brewing beer. Hoppr is catered towards the smalltime home-brewer and gives ample information about hops and their uses, as well as recipes for making various beer styles,
* Hoppr is designed to be an interactive website in which the user can get information about various hops. There a 3 separate functional pages that display different data or information about hops.
* On the first page the user selects a hop from the drop-down list, as well as what they intend to use that hop for during the brewing process. User than submits that information and a list containing various hops that could be substituted for the hop selected. In the event that user is unable to obtain the regular hop of choice, user can pick from the list which has hop name, alpha acid content and percent match to selected hop. List is displayed in browser window opposite the hop select drop-down box. On the bottom left of the page, user may choose to find a hop based off of 5 different flavor properties, 'Piney', 'Fruity', 'Spicy', 'floral' and citrus. Upon click of Find Profile button, once again , the name, alpha acid content and percent match properties of various hops are displayed opposite the profile selector.
* On the second page (description.html), a hop is selected via. a drop-down list and that hop's characteristics are displayed in the browser opposite the drop-down hop selector. Underneath, user may choose to add a new hop by entering any name, and by selecting properties from the drop-down lists. When 'Click When Done' button is clicked, all the new hops properties and values are shown opposite the hop adder. Also, it is important to know that any time a new hop is created, it is appended to the end of the hop dropdown list above, and can be selected like any other hop to display its properties and values.
* On the third page is an automated beer recipe creator. User may enter a name for the beer, and than select a hop to use for the beer brewing process. User than selects what type of beer they want to brew, for instance "Ale", or "Porter". After that they select what type of class they wish to make (ie: 'Session', 'Standard', 'Imperial', 'Double'). New recipe is rendered and displayed in the browser opposite the Automatic Recipe Builder.
* The last and final page is an about us page containing pictures of all four of us, the Hoppr group, as well as a few lines each for our personal interests. Much css animation is used in this about us page, as well as making use of transitions and transforms.
