-The name of our project is Hoppr.
-Hoppr was an idea that was proposed by our group leader,  Ben Harding.
-Hoppr was made for brewers as a resource to aid in the process of brewing
  beer. Hoppr is catered towards the smalltime home-brewer and gives ample
  information about hops and their uses, as well as recipes for making
  various beer styles,
-Hoppr is designed to be an interactive website in which the user can get
  information about various hops. There a 3 separate functional pages that
  display different data or information about hops.
-On the first page the user selects a hop from the drop-down list, as well as
  what they intend to use that hop for during brewing
  purpose of finding
 a hop is selected via. a drop-down list
  and that hop's characteristics are displayed in the browser opposite the
  drop-down hop selector.
